After adding it to your sidebar you can enter a title for the Widget, some descriptive text that will appear above the button and specify an optional purpose and reference for the donation button to override the default settings.

= Shortcode =

Insert the button in your pages or posts with this shortcode

`[GTPayment-donation]`

Which is the simplest option, and uses all default and optional settings. If you want to make a specific button for a specific purpose you can add these options:

`[GTPayment-donation purpose="Spline Importer" reference="3D Plugins"]`

as an example.
